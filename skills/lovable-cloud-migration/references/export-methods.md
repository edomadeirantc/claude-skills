# Data Export Methods

## Method 0: Native Cloud Export (PRIMARY database source)

The official export button: Cloud tab > Overview > Advanced settings > **Export project data**. Produces a `pg_dump` custom-format `.backup` (zstd compressed, inside a .zip), saved into the project's OWN Cloud storage as a bucket named like `database_export_06_07_26`. Limits: 5 GB, one export per 24 hours.

Lovable's documentation says user passwords are not exported in a usable form
and recommends a reset flow. Treat that as the default behavior. The optional
MCP route below is separate from the official export and must be verified for
each project.

| Included | Not included |
|---|---|
| Full schema: public, auth, storage, cron, vault | Storage FILES (metadata rows only - actual bytes travel separately) |
| All table data | Edge function CODE (lives in the repo) |
| RLS policies, triggers, custom functions | Edge function SECRET values (never exportable) |
| Sequences WITH current values | Vault secret VALUES (rows restore but can't decrypt cross-project) |
| Auth records, subject to verification | Usable passwords are not guaranteed; plan resets |
| cron.job rows (schedules transfer, commands point at OLD URLs) | |

Three rules:
1. **Download before Remove** - the export lives inside the Cloud storage that Remove deletes.
2. **Don't wait for the email** - the toast is unreliable; check Storage after ~1 minute.
3. **Restore needs pg_restore 16+ built WITH zstd** - brew's libpq fails regardless of version; use `postgresql@18`.

This replaces Methods 1-3 as the database source whenever the export is
available. It does not replace the auth decision: use password resets by default,
or explicitly opt into Method 1 after its capability and security checks.

## Method 1: Lovable MCP query_database (advanced, optional)

This method can preserve existing password hashes when the current project still
allows access. Requires an MCP-compatible agent with Lovable MCP connected.
Lovable MCP is a research preview, so verify capability every time.

```
Lovable MCP query_database gives full SQL access to Lovable Cloud database,
including auth.users (with encrypted passwords), all public tables, 
storage.objects, and system catalogs.
```

### Security gate before reading any hash

First run a count-only capability check. It reveals no hashes:

```sql
SELECT
  count(*) AS total_users,
  count(*) FILTER (
    WHERE encrypted_password IS NOT NULL AND encrypted_password <> ''
  ) AS users_with_password_hash
FROM auth.users;
```

Continue only when `users_with_password_hash > 0`, every expected password user
is accounted for, the user explicitly approves sensitive hash handling, and the
agent can avoid user-facing output and ordinary logs. OAuth and passwordless users
may correctly have no password hash and need their provider-specific migration
path. The hash values necessarily pass through MCP/agent execution. Never paste
them into chat, print them, commit them, or store them in a normal project
directory. Delete any protected temporary artifact after verification.

### What you can export

| Data | Query |
|---|---|
| Tables + schema | `information_schema.tables`, `information_schema.columns` |
| Constraints + FKs | `information_schema.table_constraints`, `key_column_usage` |
| Custom enums | `pg_type` + `pg_enum` |
| RLS policies | `pg_policies` |
| All table data | `SELECT * FROM each_table` |
| Auth users + passwords | `SELECT id, email, encrypted_password, raw_user_meta_data FROM auth.users` |
| Storage file list | `SELECT * FROM storage.objects` |

### Advantages
- Full access to everything including auth.users
- Can export passwords (bcrypt hashes)
- Can read schema metadata for automatic migration
- No need to deploy edge functions first

Verified history:
- Full password-preserving migration tested on 2026-03-21 and 2026-07-06.
- Count-only access to non-empty `encrypted_password` values rechecked on
  2026-08-31 without returning any hash.

If access is missing, some users have empty hashes, or handling cannot be kept
appropriately protected, stop and use the official password-reset route.

## Method 2: Edge Function Export (No Claude Code needed)

For users without Claude Code. Deploy an edge function via Lovable chat that exports data.

```
User --- X --- Database (no direct access)
  |
  +-- Edge Function -- OK -- Database (internal supabase client)
```

### Deploy via Lovable chat:

> Create an Edge Function called 'export-data' that requires a secret key in header 'x-export-key', queries all my tables, and returns everything as JSON. Add EXPORT_SECRET to environment variables.

### Edge Function template:

```typescript
import { createClient } from 'https://esm.sh/@supabase/supabase-js@2'

Deno.serve(async (req) => {
  const authHeader = req.headers.get('x-export-key')
  if (authHeader !== Deno.env.get('EXPORT_SECRET')) {
    return new Response('Unauthorized', { status: 401 })
  }

  const supabase = createClient(
    Deno.env.get('SUPABASE_URL')!,
    Deno.env.get('SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY')!
  )

  const tableNames = ['your', 'table', 'names', 'here']
  const exportData: Record<string, any[]> = {}

  for (const tableName of tableNames) {
    const { data } = await supabase.from(tableName).select('*')
    exportData[tableName] = data || []
  }

  return new Response(JSON.stringify(exportData, null, 2), {
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }
  })
})
```

### Usage:

```bash
curl -H "x-export-key: your-secret" \
  https://your-project.supabase.co/functions/v1/export-data > backup.json
```

### Limitations
- Cannot export auth.users passwords (edge functions can list users but not encrypted_password)
- Cannot export schema metadata (only data)
- Large datasets may timeout
- Requires knowing your table names

---

## Method 3: REST API Export

For tables with public SELECT RLS policies.

```bash
curl "https://PROJECT_REF.supabase.co/rest/v1/TABLE_NAME?select=*" \
  -H "apikey: ANON_KEY" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ANON_KEY" > table_backup.json
```

### Limitations
- Only works for tables with public read access
- Cannot export auth, storage, or protected tables
- Need to know the Supabase URL and anon key

---

## Method 4: Storage Export

Storage files must be exported separately from database data.

### Via MCP (recommended):
1. Query storage URLs from database columns
2. Deploy migrate-storage edge function to NEW project
3. Function downloads from old public URLs and uploads to new storage
4. See references/migrate-storage-function.md

### Via Edge Function (no Claude Code):
```typescript
const { data: files } = await supabase.storage.from('bucket-name').list()
for (const file of files) {
  const { data } = await supabase.storage.from('bucket-name').download(file.name)
}
```

## Comparison

| Method | Auth users | Passwords | Schema | Data | Storage | Requires |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Native export | Yes/verify | No usable passwords guaranteed; reset | Yes | Yes | Metadata only | One button click (+ pg_restore w/zstd) |
| MCP query_database | Yes | Yes, advanced and capability-dependent | Yes | Yes | Via URLs | MCP-compatible agent + Lovable MCP + explicit approval |
| Edge Function | Partial | No | No | Yes | Partial | Lovable chat |
| REST API | No | No | No | Partial | No | URL + anon key |

**Recommendation:** Use Method 0 for the database whenever available and plan a
password reset. Use Method 1 only when preserving passwords materially matters,
the capability check passes, and the user accepts the sensitive MCP path. Storage
files always travel separately in every method.
